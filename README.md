Hey Guys,
Are you a beginner in python and looking for projects......
Here is one for you, guess the number game.
It will generate a random number between 1 to 100(or whatever your choice) and it will provide you 5 tries to guess the number
This is completely open-source and you wouldn't need any permission to attach this code to your portfoio.
